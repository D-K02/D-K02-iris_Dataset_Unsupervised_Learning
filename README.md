# Clustering Techniques on the Iris Dataset

## Overview
This project explores clustering techniques using the well-known Iris dataset. The objective is to apply and evaluate two unsupervised learning algorithms: KMeans Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering. The project includes data preprocessing steps, implementation of clustering algorithms, and visualization of the results.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, with four features measured for each sample:
- Sepal Length (cm)
- Sepal Width (cm)
- Petal Length (cm)
- Petal Width (cm)

The dataset is available in the `sklearn` library and is commonly used for demonstrating machine learning techniques.

## Objective
The main objectives of this project are:
1. To preprocess the Iris dataset for clustering.
2. To implement KMeans Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering.
3. To visualize the clusters formed by each algorithm.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
